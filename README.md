# TestRepo
Place for me to test files, operations, and anything else before I attempt it for real on an assignment repo and make a mess.

If all goes well, this will be full of pdf's, C script, and command prompt cheat sheats. More than likely, it will end up being full of PDF's that don't compile and .c files that have segfault issues.
